<p> The Cold War was a conflict between two countries, the United States and the former Soviet Union, spanning the years 1947 to 1991. This tension arose due to the spread of communism in these nations. It was widely regarded as an unjust war, marked by devastating human losses.Following the war, the USSR faced economic challenges, eventually succumbing to the forces of capitalism. In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev assumed power and initiated significant structural reforms to rejuvenate the country. He eliminated economic aid, championed transparency, and allowed freedom of expression and universal suffrage.
    In Europe, the collapse of capitalism as a political economic system ensued. Consequently, the United States emerged as a global power, while the USSR vanished. At the national level, the United States experienced a period of peace and embraced democratic freedom.</p>
